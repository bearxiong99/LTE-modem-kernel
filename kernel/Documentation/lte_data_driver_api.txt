        Arg:ifname - The name of the interface
        Arg:epsid - The eps id assigned to this interface
        Arg:priority - The FIFO priority queue.

    Command: net_bridge_mode_ul
    Description: The net_bridge_mode_ul command is used to enable the eps id
     to MAC address mapping for UL packets. If this command is enabled, the source 
     MAC address given in this command will be used to match UL packets
     against the default bearer id associated with the PDN to identify the PDN.
     If 'disabled' then PDN will be identified based on source IPv4
     address/ network provided IPv6 interface identifier.

          0 (disabled).

    Command: net_bridge_mode_dl
    Description: The net_bridge_mode command is used to enable the eps id to
           MAC address mapping for DL packets. This command will also display the
           EPS ID to MAC table in syslog. If 'disabled' a default MAC address will be
           associated with lte0 (routed solution) and assigned to DL packets.
        Arg:enable - Enable or disable DL bridge mode. Range 0 - 1, default is
            0 (disabled).

    Command: net_eps_mac_map_add_ul
    Description: The net_eps_mac_map_add_ul command is used to add an eps id to
       MAC address mapping for determining the PDN associated with UL packets.
        Arg:epsid - The eps id of the default bearer associated with the MAC address of the interface of that PDN on the host AP.

        Arg:cmd - The 4GHIF command to issue. No range check on value, value is scanned as integer
        

Rules/Notes:

    1. All interfaces must be configured "down" via ifconfig prior to switching the QOS mode.
    2. Interface "lte0" is persistent and cannot be deleted.
    3. The : character is used as the delimiter between commands and arguments.
    4. The space character is used as delimiter between commands.
    5. The interface priority is not currently implemented.  The dequeue is currently round-robin between the interfaces.
    6. After interface creation, interfaces must then be configured via ifconfig.
    7. To delete an interface, it must be configured "down" via ifconfig so that there is no traffic on the interface.
    8. Multiple commands can be specified in the command string.
    9. The /proc/lte_dd command interface is not reentrant.
    10. All command processing results are listed via dmesg.
    11. Data driver log level 4 will display for each UL packet the interface name and eps id.
    12. The log levels are defined as follows:
    
        #define AMP_LOG_LEVEL_ERROR     2
        #define AMP_LOG_LEVEL_WARNING   3
        #define AMP_LOG_LEVEL_DEBUG1    4
        #define AMP_LOG_LEVEL_DEBUG2    5
        #define AMP_LOG_LEVEL_DEBUG3    6


Examples:

    To create a new interface named "lte7", eps id 11, priority 1, do:
    
        echo net_new:lte7:11:1 > /proc/lte_dd
    
    
    To set the log level of the data driver to 4, do:
    
        echo dd_log:4 > /proc/lte_dd
    
    
    To delete an interface named "lte4", do:
    
        echo net_delete:lte4 > /proc/lte_dd
        
        
    To create three new interfaces on one command line, do:
    
        echo net_new:lte1:6:1 net_new:lte2:7:1 net_new:lte3:8:1 > /proc/lte_dd
    
    
    To get the status of the data driver, do:
    
        cat /proc/lte_dd

        
    To set the QOS mode of the network driver to IP Tables (Uses the eps id configured for the net interface) 

        echo qos_mode:1 > /proc/lte_dd
    
        
    To enable UL profiling but don't reset the UL list 

        echo dd_ul_packet_profile:1:0 > /proc/lte_dd
        
    
    To disable DL profiling and reset the DL list 

        echo dd_dl_packet_profile:0:1 > /proc/lte_dd
   
   
    To enable special loop-back BP mode so pings from host work 

        echo dd_lpbp_mode:1 > /proc/lte_dd


    To map DL packets tagged with eps id 11 to use MAC address 00:1f:29:a1:7e:d6, do:
   
        echo net_eps_mac_map_add_dl:11:001F29A17ED6 > /proc/lte_dd


    To remove the eps id 11 to MAC mapping (uses default), do:
   
        echo net_eps_mac_map_rm_dl:11 > /proc/lte_dd


    To enable the DL network driver bridge mode and display the current EPS ID to MAC table, do:
    
        echo net_bridge_mode_dl:1 > /proc/lte_dd
        

    To enable the network driver UL bridge mode and display the current EPS ID to MAC table, do:

	echo net_bridge_mode_ul:1 > /proc/lte_dd

    To map UL packets for PDN with default bearer eps id 5 to use MAC address 00:1f:29:a1:7e:d6, do:
   
        echo net_eps_mac_map_add_ul:5:001F29A17ED6 > /proc/lte_dd


    To remove the UL eps id 5 to MAC mapping, do:
   
        echo net_eps_mac_map_rm_ul:5 > /proc/lte_dd
